For a more limited scope, hectic dungeon is pivoted to be closer to a RTS game
like into the breach. the player has a number of troops that the can control on
a preset map. the player has a preset number of moves per turn (depends on
map). the player can choose to either use the moves all on the same troop or
spread them out. attacking and moving count as one move each. the win condition
is now to defeat all the enemies on the map.

that means hectic dungeon is now more of a level based game.
